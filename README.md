# Dog Vision Identification using TensorFlow and MobileNetV2-Adam

## Overview

Welcome to the Dog Vision Identification project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model for identifying dog breeds from images using TensorFlow and the MobileNetV2 architecture with the Adam optimizer. The objective is to create an accurate model that can recognize various dog breeds, providing insights into dog vision and aiding in applications such as pet care and breed recognition.

## Project Description

Identifying dog breeds from images involves analyzing visual features specific to each breed. This project leverages deep learning techniques to build a model capable of recognizing and classifying dog breeds based on input images. The utilization of TensorFlow and the MobileNetV2 architecture ensures efficient training and high accuracy in breed identification.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used in this project is based on MobileNetV2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNetV2 offers a good balance between model size and accuracy, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of images of various dog breeds. It is essential to have a diverse and representative dataset to ensure the model's ability to generalize to unseen data effectively. The dataset may include popular dog breeds, rare breeds, and variations in pose, lighting conditions, and backgrounds to enhance the model's robustness.

The data we're using is from Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification Competition. <br>

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in preparing the dataset for training. Common preprocessing steps may include:
- Resizing images to a standard size compatible with the model input.
- Normalizing pixel values to a common scale (e.g., [0, 1]).
- Augmenting the dataset with techniques such as rotation, flipping, and color jittering to increase variability and improve model generalization.

## Training

The model is trained using the TensorFlow framework with the MobileNetV2 architecture. The Adam optimizer is employed to optimize the model parameters and minimize the classification loss. During training, the model learns to extract meaningful features from input images and make predictions regarding the dog breed present in each image.

## Evaluation

The trained model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation dataset. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify dog breeds and generalize to unseen data.

## Usage

To utilize the Dog Vision Identification model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sarthaklambaa/dog-vision-identification.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies, including TensorFlow and other required libraries.

3. Preprocess your dataset, ensuring proper resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

4. Train the model using the provided scripts or Jupyter Notebooks.

5. Evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation dataset and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for breed identification tasks in your application or environment.
